                I was introduced to the world of programming in 9th Grade when I
                took my first Computer Science class. For many years,
                programming was nothing to me but a bunch of If-else statements
                with little-to-no practical applications. I wasn't inspired by
                the field, and considered switching my area of study.

                This all changed the moment I started to work on projects that
                added value for clients. Through working at a range of companies
                including <b color="rgb(202, 205, 208)">AVPN</b>,{" "}
                <b color="rgb(202, 205, 208)">EY</b>, and{" "}
                <b color="rgb(202, 205, 208)">Nintex</b>, I learned to build and
                deliver products for a diverse range of clients. It was these
                experiences that demonstrated the ability of technology to
                change the lives of others.

                Since this realization, I've been driven to create apps that aim
                to ease user experiences. If I can create something that will
                solve even just one personâ€™s problem, I consider that a victory.

                Other than programming, I'm either playing padel, cooking,
                DJ-ing or watching any and every major sports tournament.

                This site is not just intended to be a showcase of my endeavors
                as a programmer, but rather a documentation of all of my feats
                (and setbacks) as I navigate through this beautiful gift of
                life.
